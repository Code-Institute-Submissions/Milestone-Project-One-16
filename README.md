# **TinFoT (TeamFight Tactics info)**

## **Milestone project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute**

A website which explains different aspects of the game "Teamfight Tactics".
It is aimed as a free-use project for both new an experienced players looking
for a more convenient overview of information about the game.

## UX

### **Goals:**
* Focus on the essential information with the assumption the user 
    already has an understanding of the rules of the game.

* Make it quick to navigate, allowing users to find the specific
information they were looking for .

* To make the website as aesthetically pleasing as possible, encouring return visits
by making regular visits an enjoyable and positive experience.

* To make the site stand out from other websites which fulfill similar 
roles.

### **User Stories**

I asked a number of people in the gaming community what 
they look for in a website like mine.

>Game wiki websites are often cluttered with information. It makes for
interesting reading if I'm in the mood but usually I want a basic bit of information
not the whole game's lore (**Content**)

> - Coburn Martin

>I wish some gaming websites were a bit brighter. Every site is so gloomy. (**Aesthetic**)

> - Ebba GÃ¤rdekrans

>I am usually looking at information whilst simultaneuosly playing the game 
so i want to find the information I'm looking for quickly so I can get back
to actually playing the game. (**Accessibility**)

>-Nancy Oliveira

### **Strategy**

The aim was to create a bright and colourful website which only presented the 
user with most essential information and to make it quick and easy to reach 
any specific bit of information. 

### **Scope**

A website like this would normally require a database. With that in mind the 
website must be designed as a demo which shows off all the aspects that the full 
website would contain. This means that any repition of templates should be avoided.

### **Structure**

Quick navigation is essential to this project. All of the sections are on the same page
and the navigation bar sticks to the top of the screen. Only by clicking on the "read more"
link in the champions section will take the user away from the main page. This means only 
the most essential information is displayed.
